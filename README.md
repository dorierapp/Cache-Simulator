# Cache-Simulator
Simulates an L1 write-through cache using a first-in-first-out replacement policy.
The input is a series of memory access traces, consisting of a read or write isntruction and a memory address accessed during program execution,
which it uses to determine whether each access is a hit or a miss and handles it accordingly.
The cache size, associativity, and the block size are input parameters.

trace files are test cases.
